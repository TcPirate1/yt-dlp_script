# YT-DLP script to download songs from a CSV file

To be honest I have spent too much time copy and pasting URLs into this incredibly useful utility and am ashamed I didn't think to write a script for this earlier.

# Development requirements
- pip (for the YT-DLP package)

# Useful YT-DLP arguments
- `-x` extracts audio
- `ytsearch`, `ytstories`: searches Youtube and stories
- `-P` followed by directory entry will save the download in specified location

# Post development (ideas)
- Pyinstaller
