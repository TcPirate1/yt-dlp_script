# YT-DLP script to download songs

Doesn't seem to be able to do what I imagined so pivoting to making a command-line program.

# Development requirements
- yt-dlp
- pipx (For packaging into command-line program)

# Useful YT-DLP arguments
- `-x` extracts audio
- `ytsearch`, `ytstories`: searches Youtube and stories
- `-P` followed by directory entry will save the download in specified location
